        Title: {title}
        {"Character full Names: " + ', '.join(character_names) if character_names else ""}

        First, create an opening scene:
        1. Scene Number: 1
        2. Description: {opening_scene_instructions.get(story_type, opening_scene_instructions["general"])}
        3. Subtitles: An engaging question that captures the essence of the {story_type} and piques the viewer's interest.

        2. Description: A vivid description (60-70 words) focusing on key visual elements. {type_guidelines.get(story_type, type_guidelines["general"])}
        3. Subtitles: Use EXACT quotes from the original text. 
        4. Transition: Specify the type of transition to the current scene.

        Guidelines:
        - Subtitles MUST contain only exact text from the original text, without any additions, omissions, or modifications.
        - Include every sentence from the original text in the subtitles, maintaining the correct order across all scenes.
        - Each subtitle must be unique; do not repeat content in multiple scenes.
        - For partial sentences at scene boundaries, include the fragment and continue it in the next scene's subtitles.
        - EVERY SCENE MUST HAVE NON-EMPTY SUBTITLES. If you run out of story text, do not create additional scenes.
        - Ensure that the scenes flow logically and capture the essence of the {story_type}.
        - The total number of scenes should not exceed {max_scenes}.
        - When using a character's name in possessive form (e.g., "Character's") in the description, 
          surround it with double curly braces {{{{ }}}} if it's not referring to the character's appearance. 
          For example: "{{{{Giovanni's}}}} workshop" or "The mysterious figure stood at the entrance of {{{{Giovanni's}}}} laboratory."

        Use only the following options for transition details:
        - Transition types: zoom-in, zoom-out

        Guidelines for using zoom-in, and zoom-out transitions:
        - Zoom-in: Use to focus on important details, build tension, or show a character's point of view. Examples: revealing a clue, emphasizing a character's reaction, or creating suspense.
        - Zoom-out: Use to reveal context, end a scene, or show isolation. Examples: showing a character in a larger environment, concluding a sequence, or transitioning from a detail to a wider view.

        Important rules:
        1. Do not use zoom-in transitions when the current scene's shot size is close-up or extreme close-up.
        2. For transitions, use ONLY the following types:
            - zoom-in
            - zoom-out
        3. DO NOT use any other transition types, including fade, dissolve, or cut.
